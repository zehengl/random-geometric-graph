## Introduction

> In graph theory, a random geometric graph (RGG) is the mathematically simplest spatial network, namely an undirected graph constructed by randomly placing N nodes in some metric space (according to a specified probability distribution) and connecting two nodes by a link if and only if their distance is in a given range, e.g. smaller than a certain neighborhood radius, r.

## Environment

- Windows 10
- MSYS2 64 bit 20200720
- Qt Creator 4.12.4
- _openFrameworks Nightly Build_ (of_v20200818_msys2_mingw64)

Note: The original codes were developed back in 2013 on a Mac with a different version of openFrameworks.
I figure it would be interesting to revisit the repo and migrate it to Windows.
However, as of August 18, 2020, I couldn't make it work with the recent release (0.11.0) of openFrameworks.
See [Compilation failing due to confliting definition in openal](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/compilation-failing-due-to-confliting-definition-in-openal/33927).
I ended up with a nightly build that comes with a fix.
